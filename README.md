### Alerts
Is a class full? Get an alert when someone drops or a new section is added.

### Advanced course data (paid)
This would include hot info such as the average grade students recieved, number of tests given, easyness rating, etc.

### Schedule Recommendations
Need a filler course? Schedule Recommendations recommends a course to perfectly complement your schedule (takes into account time of other courses, preffered workload, etc.). It's autocomplete for your schedule.

### Auto Schedule
Takes Schedule Recommendations to the next level. Intelgently recommends an entire schedule based on parameters (preffered class time, workload, credits needed, GE's needed, etc.). This would likely need access to students transcripts to be most effective.

### OnTrac
Visual interface conveying where a student is based on remaining credits, expected graduation date, etc. No more trips to the academic advisor! (would need access to student's transcript)
